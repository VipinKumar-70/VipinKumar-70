# Hi there, I'm Vipin Kumar! 👋  

## 🚀 About Me  

### MERN Stack Developer | MCA Candidate  

I am a full-stack developer specializing in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with strong frontend expertise in React and modern JavaScript (ES6+).

I build scalable web applications with secure authentication, REST API integration, and structured backend architecture. Along with hands-on industry experience, I actively develop production-level full-stack projects to strengthen system design and performance optimization skills.

I am currently pursuing my MCA and looking for opportunities where I can contribute to impactful full-stack products and grow as a software engineer.
